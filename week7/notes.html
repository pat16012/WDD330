<p>CH11: Further Functions</p>
<p></p><br>
.description proper can be added to a function and explain what it does. <br>
To use temporary variables use 'temp'. <br>
Don't fall into Callback Hell! <br>
Use Promises for future results. It will be resolved or rejected. <br>
Create new promise const promise = new promise((resolve, reject) => { <br>
if(success) { <br>
resolve(value); <br>
} else { <br>
reject(error); <br>
} <br>
}); <br>
Promises can be chained together. <br>
<br>
Async Functions: <br>
used with async keyword, allows to write asynchronose code as if it was synchronous. <br>
achieved by using the await operator before the asynchronous function. <br>
Functions can return functions. <br>

Closures: <br>
outer() function can only access its variables. <br>
inner() functions can access its variables but also the variables from the outer(). <br>


<p>CH13: AJAX</p>
<p>AJAX allows the JavaScript to request resources from the server for the client <br>
fetch() method only has one argument the URL of the resource needed. <br>
    use fetch() to send a request and then get a response <br>
    redirect() can be used to redirect to another URL. <br>
    text() takes text from the response and returns a promised resolved as a string in JS. <br>
    blob() is used to read a file with raw data and return a blob object. <br>
    json() Json is the most common AJAX response. used to transform JSON data into a JS object. <br>
    <br>
    Get request to retrieve resources <br>
    POST can perform any task <br>
    PUT request ti upsert, to insert a resource or update it entirely <br>
    PATCH request makes partial updates to a resource <br>
    DELETE requests to delete resources
