<h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
<p>CH5: Objects</p><br>
<p>Object literals are a set of related values and functions <br>
Creating objects const spiderman = {}; <br>
const spiderman = new Object(); <br>
accessing object properties uses .Dot notation <br>
    calling methods of object superman.fly() <br>
    Objects are copied by reference <br>
    JavaScript uses getters and setters <br><br>
    RegExp is used in Strings to match patterns or find specific things like 'ing' <br>
    at the end of words. <br>
    use the Math object for any mathematics and computing
</p><br>
<p>CH6: Document Object Model</p><br>
<p>DOM or Document Object Model <br>
    Getting elements â€• getElementById , getElementsByClassName , getElementsByTagName , querySelector and querySelectorAll
    <br>
    Dom represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes <br>
    Node lists are array like objects but not Arrays. <br>
    jQuery finds elements on the page with Css like syntax <br>
    Legacy DOM allows access with .Dot notation. <br>
    innerHTML can be used to insert raw html onto the document. It cannot be used to insert Scripts.
</p><br>
<p>CH7: Events</p><br>
<p>Event listeners are waiting for an action then it does something <br>
Event object function doSomething(event) {
    console.log(event.type);
    } <br>
