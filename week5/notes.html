<p>
    Exception error is a return value used by program to deal with an error. <br>
    Exception will produce a stack trace. This will help lead to the error. <br>
    Chrome inspect is a powerful tool to know when something is not working right and to fix bugs. <br>
    Alerts are used to display something to the User. <br>
    Console.log() can be used to see what values are in your variables and also what is bring returned. <br>
    Error objects are used when an exception happens. <br>
    try,catch, finally can be used for exception handling <br>
    Test Driven development uses tests throughout the code to make sure everything is working as expected. <br>
    Tests are written sometimes before the code. <br>
