    <p>CH8: Forms</p>
    <p>Reset Buttons are considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to erase <br>
        the entire form. <br>
        form.action = '/an/other.url' used to set the form action attribute so its sent to a <br>
        different url. <br>
        Pulling user values from form ${input.value} in JS script <br>
        placeholder = 'enterSomething here' used to have some information in the form input box before the user enters something
        <br>
        HTML5 .focus() in JS focuses on the element once the page loads. <br>
        Form Validation: <br>
        Used to make sure the user enters the requested Data in the Form you wanted.
        HTML5 has an API for basic validation. Custom validation might be required for your purposes.
    </p><br>

    <p>CH12: Object Oriented Programming</p>
    <p>Constructor can be used to create new object using the new operator<br>
        Private methods can only be access from within the object. <br>
        public methods can be access from outside the object. <br>
        getters and setters can be used to access the data from private methods. <br>
        Inheritance can be used in JS objects <br>
        Mixins allow adding properties and methods from one object to another without inheritance. <br>
        Factory Functions can be used with copy(enter object here) to have a function return an object. <br>
        Chaining functions: superman.fly().move().xray(); with call all the specified functions. <br>
        ES6 arrow functions do not have their over .this context, .this remains bound to the original object. <br>
        ES6 allows for Modules to be used <br>
        use import {} from './your.js' to import another JS file. <br>
        use export {function1, function2} to export your functions. <br>
        import {function1, function2} from './yourJSfile'; to import specific functions from another JS file. <br>
        import * as nameThis from './yourJSfile'; imports all values and functions from the JS file.
        nameThis.function({2,6,10}); allows you to put in your of vales into the functions with the namespace of nameThis
        <br>
        single/multiple functions and values can be exported.
        objects can also be exported. <br>
        Do not have more than one default export, the result would be a syntax error. <br>
        MVC: <br>
        models: objects the implement functionality for creating,reading,updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks). <br>
        Views: provide visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In web app this would be
        <br>
        the HTML displayed on the web page. <br>
        Controllers: link models and views together by communicating between them. Controllers respond to events, process the data
        <br>
        and update the model and view. <br>
        MV* with JS rather than MVC since JS does not strictly follow the controller pattern. <br>
        MV* Frameworks: <br>
        Aurelia which uses ES6 <br>
        Angular - created by google. Uses ng- attributes. <br>
        Vue - open source framework that takes the best of React & Angular <br>
        Templates: MVC frameworks use templating to insert dynamic data into the pages. <br>
    <h1> Hello {{ name }}</h1> uses templating to insert a name. Some frameworks use handlebars {{}}, <br>
    EJS uses <%= name => <br>


    <br>

    <p>CH:15 Modern Javascript</p>
    <p>
        Libraries: makes life easier and more exciting! <br>
        jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library. <br>
        jQuery works with older browsers. Since we are in the future people can use a newer and more secure browser. <br>
        Libraries can speed things up a lot, but you also do not know all the code contained inside unless you go <br>
        and look through it. <br>
        React from Facebook & Vue use virtual DOM's to speed up page loading. <br>
        Web Apps are becoming large and to keep them organized having a proper file system goes a long way to have <br>
        clean easy to read and de-dug code. <br>
        The use of libraries and packages have sped up the process of making dynamic pages.
