<h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
<p>CH8: Transforms and Transitions</p>
<p>
    Transforms: <br>
    - CSS3 transforms allow you to translate, rotate, scale and/or Skew any element on the page. <br>
    - CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the elements appearance compaired with <br>
    CSS2. <br>
    - change transforms origin with transform-origin:0,0; <br> <br>
       Translation: <br>
    a. translation allows you to move the element up/down/left/right, similar to position: <br>
    relative. <br>
    b. unlike position: relative, translation can only be moved relative to its current position. <br> <br>

    Transforms & older browsers: <br>
    older browsers require pre-fixing to make it work. Syntax is online to support this. <br>
    <br>
    Scaling: <br>
    - Scaling scale(x, y), defines the scales of an element horizontally then vertically. <br>
    <br>
    Rotation: <br>
    - rotate(), rotates an element around the point of origin. <br>
    <br>
    Skew: <br>
    - skew(x,y), specifies a skew along the x and y axis. <br>
    <br>

    Transitions: <br>
    -   Transitions are used to add animation features to your elements. <br>
    <br>

</p><br>
<p>CH12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</p>
<br>
    Canvas: <br>
    - Canvas is new in HTML5's API, allowing anything to be drawn all through javascript. <br>
    - Canvas element is made with "< canvas >< /canvas >" <br>
    <br>
    SVG: <br>
    - SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics <br>
    - SVG is a file-format that allows the vector graphic to be described with XML. <br>
    - creating SVG element < SVG> < /SVG>. <br>
<br>
    Drag & Drop: <br>
    - The Drag & Drop api allows us to specify certain elements that are draggable, then specify what happens when <br>
the element is dragged to a specific location. <br>
    <br>
